For MG Survive version 1.04 (in title screen) 1.0.5.0 in exe

A mod for Metal Gear Survive intended to extend gameplay through customizable settings and features.

Full features and options:
See the Features and Options.html file in the Lost Heaven .zip

Disclaimer:
------------------------------
Use the mod at you own risk (which can be mitigated by backing up saves and files replaced by mod)
This mod is still largely untested, detailed feedback at Nexus page welcome.

Installation
------------------------------
See: Installation.txt file in the Lost Heaven .zip 

Usage:
------------------------------
Lost Heaven menu:

While in the title at avatar select (Safe-space menu), or in-mission (In-mission menu)
Press and hold <Switch Zoom> (V key or RStick click) then press <Dash> (shift key or LStick click) to toggle the mod menu.

The menu system will display the current
[#]: [Option name] : [Setting value or description] [menu item type symbol]
Example:
4: Mobility level : Grade 2

Menu item type symbols:
Sub-menu >
Command >>
Command that closes menu when done >]
[Option Name] <Action> : [Setting]
Selected setting is applied by pressing <Action> 

While menu is open:
Use Dpad to navigate the menu
or
Hold <Switch Zoom> (V key or RStick click) and press movement keys or Left Stick to navigate the menu.

Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open sub menu.

The size/step of the setting change can be made bigger/smaller by holding <Ready weapon> or <Fire>. 

Press <Binoculars> button to reset current setting.

Press <Reload> button to set the current setting to it's minimum.
Press <Change Stance> button to go to previous menu.

By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via the in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.

Quick Menu:
A way to quickly trigger certain Lost Heaven commands.
(Must be enabled via option in IH system menu, or by editing InfQuickMenuDefs.lua)

When enabled hold the <Zoom Change> button then hold one of the following:

<Ready weapon>(Right mouse or Left Trigger) to warp to last placed usermarker
<Fire>(Left mouse or Right Trigger) to open the menu to heli-to last usermarker (a kludge, but necesary to activate the inter landingzone ride on heli)
<Action>(E key or Y button) to activate TSM
<Reload>(R key or B button) to activate Free cam
<Change Stance>(C key or A button) to have Quiet move to last usermarker

Profiles:
Profiles are lists of settings for IH options, can be used as an alternative, or in conjunction with IHs in-game menu.
See MGS_TPP\mod\profiles\All_Options_Example.lua for more info.

Settings save file:
LH writes its settings to ih_save.lua in the MGS_TPP\mod\saves folder.
While the file is editable, editing an inMission save is likely to cause issues.
