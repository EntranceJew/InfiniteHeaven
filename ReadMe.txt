InfiniteHeaven

tex:
Mod for MGSV, and the lua files for gz, mgo, ssd and some scattered analysis and external scripts and other mess.

repo was built from uploading manual snapshots I had of IH up to r233, has most of the release versions (and a few in-between), but have a few missing.

Due to that history includes evolution of mockfox to current (though actual project has since been moved to its own repo).

Beyond being my source control and possible future collaboration a public repo gives me options to optimise IH release builds (like running it through a minifier) and still allow community members to poke at the code.

Currently for your personal research and archiving purposes, I retain control over public releases.

Assets that are duplicates or modifications of MGSV assets may only be used in MGSV.

Actual Infinite Heaven mod in tpp (dev version) and tpp-release. Mod is built by seperate program mgsv_buildmod which is still in private repo since it's still pretty bespoke mess. You can get a rough idea on what it does by looking at tpp\build-infinite_heaven.json
