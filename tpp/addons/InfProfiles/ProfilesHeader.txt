-- InfProfiles.lua
-- Profiles are lists of settings for IH options. 
-- IH only reads this file/does not write to it. 
-- In-game the settings are saved to your save file when mission saves (usually during mission load).

-- Options are added and sometimes changed as IH develops, use the defaults profile and compare with a prior version using a tool like WinMerge to see changes to make sure your own profiles are correct.
