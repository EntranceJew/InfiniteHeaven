Vehicle patrols should no longer cause vehicle sideops vehicles to be invisible.

Wildcard soldiers: number increased to 1/5 of total cps, number of female wildcard soldiers increased to 2. Added full range of female faces. to wildcard females

New for r133:
Fix: Head markers off did not work on heli entry - thanks washtubs for the report.
Player restriction option: Disable world markers - thanks brunovisk114 for the suggestion
In mission menu: Markers menu, includes head and world marker options, toggling xray at runtime unforntunately doesnt work via script.

MB suit (male) options added: Soviet All, PF All - randomly chooses suit from all options of that type including unique.

New for r131:
Fix: Hang at FOB load screen, thanks SoullessMadness for the report. FOB defense hang on load unconfirmed since it's harder to test.

Soldier Parameters option: Hearing distance scale

Mother base option: "Female staff selection" - "Default","None","All available"
In the regular game it tries to put at least 2 female staff per cluster (from that section)
All available will prioritize putting your female staff first.
None will prevent any female staff appearing on mother base.

Mother base option: DD Suit female - lets you select the suit of females independantly as there are more suits that are male only.

Vehicle patrols menu renamed Enemy patrols menu

Vehicle Patrols: Improved soldier assignment, jeeps may have 2-4 soldiers, tanks now have just the driver, to fix the sillyness of a guy hopping in and out every time it spots you.
[youtube]5uWBfTL7HVM[/youtube]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uWBfTL7HVM

Enemy patrols option: Foot patrols in free roam - adds ~13 foot patrols between CPs, since the start-end bases are chosen randomly they may be difficult to find or you may be surprised by them in the wilderness between rather than following roads.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vPVBpcz0iY

New for r128
Motherbase menu:
Expanded DD Suit to include XOF,Soviet and each PF. This changes the soldierType so the normal type of body model and equipment is selected (assuming other options aren't set to override), however non english speaking soldiertypes will be mostly silent as they don't have equivalent lines in their soundbanks.

MB DD nonlethal shifted to the DD Equip menu.

Mother Base War Games expanded to include Enemy Invasion, and Zombie Obliteration, both replace the motherbase soldier with non-staff member and enable players use of lethal weapons and also disable demon points for kill actions.

Player Restriction - disable of game settings to customize your challenge
-----------------
Includes Subsistence profiles, sets of customized settings that lets you go into any mission or free roam with same (and more) restrictions as subsistence missions, or with just a secondary of your choice.

Pure - as the missions with more restrictions: OSP forced, Items off, Hand upgrades off, ASAP time forced, vehicle off, fulton  off, support off, head markers off, heli attack off, central landing zones off.

Bounder - Pure as base but allows: Buddy, changing Suit (which should also allow model swaps), Level 1 Fulton, head markers

OSP Weapon settings - Separate from subsistence mode (but subsistence uses it), allows you to enter a mission with primary and secondary weapons set to none, individually setable.

Arm abilitiy levels - Sonar, Mobility, Precision, Medical - can now be individually set.

Disable Head markers independently from objective/placed markers (markers for other objects like vehicles/fultonable weapons are also disabled however due to the game function).

Disable Xray marking - buddies that mark still cause the effect though.

Mission Entrance/Exit options:

Start on foot - skip heli ride into mission and start on the ground.

Abort Mission (Return to ACC) added to Motherbase pause menu.

"Disable retry", "Game over on combat alert" - to replicate total stealth settings

Fulton success profile/options:
------------------------------
Found in Player restrictions\Fulton success menu
Options:
"Disable MB fulton support" - disregards the success bonus from mother base support section, in the base game this is mostly used to counter weather penalty.
"Disable MB fulton medical" - disregards the success bonus from mother base medical section, in the base game this used to counter injured target penalty.
"Target dying penalty"
"Target sleeping penalty"
"Target holdup penalty"
"Dont apply MB medical to sleeping/fainted target" - lets you balance sleeping penalty separately from dying while keeping mb medical bonus.

Fulton profile: Heaven,
The extraction game mechanic in MGSV could do with an entire article, but the gist of the reasoning behind the settings I chose for the "Heaven" profile mostly revolve around soldier extraction. To promote the manual extraction actions (heli extraction, mission hotzone auto-fulton) which have a cost of player time, for a reward of a guaranteed success (providing you don't let the enemy kill them at the last second lol). Vs the quicker but possibly more dangerous fulton actions.
Injured enemies already promote manual extraction from their success penalty.
Sleeping or fainting enemies have no penalty in the default game, since they also make no noise above the fulton this pushes the player to use this option far too much. Heaven adds a success penalty to this state to push player to other options.
Fultoning a held up soldier is already more risky due to their increased noise when they are fultoned, the default games success penalty on this pushes players away from this, the reduction of the penalty for this profile, combined with the sleeping penalty make it more viable.


Extraction is a big part of the game, soldier extraction has the most actions associated with it.
Even before we get to fulton extraction there's a number of manual extraction options:
Heli extraction, manually transporting the target to the heli.
Mission auto-extraction - for many missions and quests transporting the target out of the hotzone will autofulton them with 100% success.

The profiles settings:

Turned off both mother base bonuses and manually balanced around mid range of mb rank table, this is so the settings will remain impactful (and because I don't want to try and ballance over a wide range of values at the moment lol)
"Target dying penalty" - mid range but a big impact, evens out to 40% fail.
"Target sleeping penalty" - Increased from 0 to 20% fail, the main reason I started this feature. In the base game, ignoring the success rate, fultoning a sleeping/fainted enemy is the safest option, so the player will do it straight away most times.

Target holdup penalty - reduced to 5.
In the game having a held-up/awake target is already dangerous, they are noisy when being fultoned, having a success penalty on top of this promotes the easy/safer option of sleeping target too much.
Holdup is however the fallback value so I'm giving it at least some value to keep some impact and push the player to manual extraction if they want a guaranteed success.

Enemy Preparedness:
----------------
Reset - resets enemy prep levels to 0

Max - the same 'revenge system' max as the extreme missions. Most soldiers have gear equipped, such as helmets, body armor, nvg, many heavy weapons deployed.

Enemy prep profile 'Heaven'
The current prefered settings for the options below it.

Resupply in #missions - the number of missions the enemy dispatch/resupply with unlock after your last successful dispatch mission for that type.

"Apply enemy prep to guard posts"

"Apply enemy prep to LLRP soldiers"

"Allow heavy armor in free mode"
"Allow heavy armor in all missions"
"Allow helmet and NVG or Gas mask combo"
"Ballance heavy armor and head gear distribution" - adjusts application percentages of the normally mutally exclusive options of heavy armor and the different headgear pieces, not necessary if "Allow helmet and NVG or Gas mask combo" is on
"Random CP subtype in free mode" - randomizes the CP subtype - PF types in middle Affrica, urban vs general camo types in Afghanistan
"Random CP subtype in missions"
"Allow missile combo with other weapons" - in the normal game soldiers with missiles only have SMGs, this allows them to have MGs, shotguns or assault rifles assigned to them.
"Disable convert armor to sheild (if armor off)" - Where heavy armor is disabled (free mode by default) the normal game converts armor to sheilds in addition to the normal shield application, this often leads to it feeling like there's just too many.
"Disable weapon restrictions in certain missions" - Missions 2, 12, 13, 16, 26, 31 prevent the application of shields, missiles, shotguns and mgs to the general CP enemy prep (though some may have custom enemy prep).
"Enable Mg vs Shotgun variation" - In the default game the enemy prep config chooses randomly either MG or Shotguns which is applied for all CPs in the whole mission. This setting allows mixed MGs and Shotguns (but still with the enemy prep total) and also applies them per CP.
"Balance small CPs" - adds limits and some randomisation to small cp/lrrps enemy prep application, best for the "Apply enemy prep to guard posts" and " to LRRP"

Custom enemy prep config. Sidesteps the enemy prep levels and gives more control over enemy prep loadout, chooses randomly between min/max of each setting:
Weapon deployment percentages -
Armor deployment percentages - Armor, soft armod (body vest), shield.
Headgear deployment percentages - helmet, gas mask, nvg.
CP detterant percentages - mines, decoys, cameras.
Soldier ability/counter levels.
Weapon strength menus. 'Strong weapons' are different variant/model of weapon for that chosen type.
Reinforce count - number of reinforcement calls a CP has.
Vehicle reinforcement level: Works with the vehicle reinforcement settings.
Ignore combat-deploy supply blocks - Ignores the current results of the Combat Deployment/Dispatch/'cut off the supply' missions that affect enemy prep.

The order of items in the menu is generally order the equipment is allocated to each soldier in a CP.

DD Equip:
-------------
DD equip options reworked and extended to enemy soldiers via DD Equip menu (via enemy prep menu or mother base menu)
The DD equipment table is decided by a random grade between DD Equip Grade Min/Max, and by default is limited to the equipment you have developed with Allow undeveloped DD equipment choosing from the full range of (security equipable) equipment.
Note: Equip grade 3 is the minimum grade that has all types of weapons.

Known issue: Some weapons will not give the proper name when picked up and have a blank icon, some weapons scopes will be blacked out.


Mother Base soldier tweaks:
-----------------
Weapon loadout - using fob equip grade and range

Suits - same range as fob missions

DD Head gear - Off,Use Equip Grade

War Games - set mother base soldiers hostile with non-lethal or lethal weapons, zombified, as true enemies (non staff).

Enable all buddies in motherbase - does not clear D-Horse and D-Walker if set from deploy screen and returning to mother base, they will however spawn inside building geometry, use the call menu to have them respawn near.
Also allows buddies on the Zoo platform, now you can take D-Dog or D-Horse to visit some animals.

Enemy parameters:
-----------------
Soldier profile - switch to off if you're combining with a modded soldier parameter table, or custom to allow the following settings:

Soldier health scaling 900-0% (requires Enemy Parameters Tweaked), 0% will kill off all enemies

Soldier sight scale - A rough scale over all the soldier sight distances, use the command 'Print sight param table (look in log - all tab)' to see exact values.

Player Settings:
Player health scaling 900-0%(1hp)

Use selected soldier in cutscenes and missions - shows your avatar or selected dd solider in cutscenes and missions that usually don't allow.

Headgear (Cosmetic) - Several different headgear options.

Subtract/Add demon points - changes demon score.

Vehicle patrol vehicle types:
------------------
For free mode change the traveling  trucks to other vehicle types:
Randomly selects from enabled vehicle type list with either one type for all, or each type chosen.
Types:
Jeeps
Trucks
Wheeled armored vehicles
Heavy wheeled armored vehicles
Tanks

Enemy vehicle reinforcements
---------------------------
Options to enable the games 'super reinforce' which by default was only used in a few missions (and the normal mission scripting makes it less noticeable)
In free mode currently only enemy heli reinforce works, in missions other vehicles will work if the mission is set up right (but still in more missions than default).

Enable enemy reinforce - Enemy prep: Uses the Enemy preparation combat value. Force Prep: Ignores if the Enemy prep value is not set.

Force enable enemy heli reinforce (disable heli sideops) - the normal game actually hijacks the reinforce system for sideops with helis, this disables those sideops so the heli can be used.

Force reinforce request - reinforce will ignore reinforce count limit or coms disabled.

Disable reinforce heli pullout - prevents the heli retreating when damaged.


Side ops:
-----------------
Unlock random Sideops for areas - The normal games sideops system breaks the map into areas, with only one sideop allowed to be active at a time. In the retail game it's chosen in a first found manner. Uncompleted story missions and uncompleted sideops get priority of selection over replayable sideops.
This setting changes it to a random selection of potential sideops, with the same priorities. Force replay adds completed sideops to the potential selection. Force Open adds most sideops to the selection pool.

Open specific sideop - enables that specific sideop.

Warning: still largely untested, unknown how replaying the story missions affect things.

Cutscenes:
-----------------
Use current soldier in cutscenes instead of snake.

Disable Mother Base cutscenes - Disables some arrive at motherbase cutscenes that cause infinite loading screens on some saves. This bug also occurs on unmodified games. If you have a save already stuck in this state (already at the MB loading screen) try my separate 'MB loading screen fix' mod.

Play selected mother base cutscene - Can choose from many of the mother base cutscenes that play on returning. Requires the setting 'MB cutscene play mode' to be set to 'Play selected'

Override Time, Override weather  - thanks qwertyuiop1234567899 for the suggestion

'Show assets Menu' in Mother base Menu:

Show mother base assets - Big Boss posters, Nuke Elimination Monument, Sahelanthropus, Eli (in theory, haven't actually seen him though), Code Talker (the game doesn't animate or have collision for him).

Don't lock goal doors - useless unless you like swishing doors.

Don't disable Ocelot after cutscenes - with this you can leave Occelot on MB in person after some cutscenes.

Don't disable buddies after cutscenes - likewise with buddies (ddog mostly)

Enemy phases:
-----------------
Adjust minimum and maximum alert phase for enemy Cps

Phase on vehicle attack - the enemy reactions to heavy vehicle attack in the default game are lacking, you can kill someone and they'll act as if it's an unsourced attack. This option changes phase of soldiers command post on damaging the soldier. Setting it to ALERT recommended.
In the Enemy phases menu but independent from Enable phase modifications

Warp Mode:
-----------------
Essentially no-clip mode (for those that remember what that means). It teleports your player a small distance each update of which warp direction button you press or hold. Will move you through walls/geometry.

The menu navigation/dpad/arrow keys will warp you in that direction, <STANCE> will warp you down and <CALL> will warp you up.

Be careful when warping up as gravity will kill you quick. One method to cope is to hold warp up, let gravity slowly take over then just after you touch the ground and start warping up again let go.

Free cam:
-----------------
Lets you move a detached camera, use the main movement stick/keys in combination with other keys/buttons to adjust camera settings.


Support Heli menu - ACC and in-mission menu:
----------------------------------------------------
Start on foot option has been moved here.
Disable heli attack - also here (but still in subsistence menu too).

Set heli invincible - heli will not take damage.

Disable pull-out - prevents heli from leaving when you jump on-board, so you can use the gun from a stationary position, or just change your mind and jump out again.
Press <STANCE> while in the heli to get it to pull-out again (or use menu).
NOTE: Disable pull-out will prevent the mother base helitaxi selection menu, press <STANCE> to re-enable or use the mod menu.

Mission start time till open door - Time from mission start to you opening the door to sit on the side. You can set this lower or 0 to do it immediately, or longer to ride the heli in first person.
Press <STANCE> to manually open the door.

Set LZ wait height - the height at which the heli hovers in wait mode (not landing mode).

Force searchlight - change the heli searchlight state


Patchups:
-----------------
Unlock playable avatar - unlock avatar before mission 46

Unlock weapon customization - game progression unlock without having to complete legendary gunsmith missions

Return Quiet - instantly runs same code as the Reunion mission 11 replay.

Start Offline - Start the game in offline mode, this also removes the connect option from the pause menu.

Retail Bug fixes:

Enemies Revenge system level for Fulton was fulton was 0 low, 1 blank, 2 high, now 0 blank 1 low 2 high.

TppMission.GoToEmergencyMission() -> TppDefine.STORY_MISSION_LAYOUT_CODE[missionCode] instead of vars.missionCode

Disable mission intro credits

Feature:
Abort to ACC from title continue. Hold down ESCAPE for 1.5 seconds, the kjp logo will flash, clicking on continue will load ACC instead of continuing mission.



By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via infinite heavens in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.

Disclaimers:
------------------------------
Use the mod at you own risk (which can be mitigated by backing up saves and files replaced by mod)
This mod is still largely untested, feedback at Nexus page welcome.

Thanks:
------------------------------
Kojima Productions for the great game
Sergeanur for qartool
atvaark for his fox tools
ThreeSocks3 for finding the custom text output for Announce log. Check out his mods.
emoose for cracking lua in fpks
jRavens for testing
Topher for the great mod manager Snakebite
rikimtasu for Chinese translation
All the mod users on nexus for trying the mod and bug reports

Preparation/insurance:
------------------------------
Back up your save files for safety
<steam path>\userdata\<user id>\287700 and
<steam path>\userdata\<user id>\311340

MGSV uses two save folders
- 311340 is Ground Zeros steam id, but used by MGSV for save data even if GZ is not installed.
- 287700 is TPP steam id, most of the files here seem to be just backup, except for TPP_GRAPHICS_CONFIG

Copy both folders to a safe place.

You may want to back up periodically as you play in case you come across save breaking issues with the mod.

Back up TPPs original 00.dat and 01.dat in
<steam path>\steamapps\common\MGS_TPP\master\0\
This does not apply if you've already modded it.

If you installed an earlier version of Infinite heaven than r44 manually find and restore your original game 00.dat backup or revalidate the game through steam:

Right click on the game in steam library, choose properties from bottom of menu, local files tab, verify integrity of game cache button.
or click this steam://validate/287700

If it gets stuck at 0% for more than a few minutes steam is being stupid, validate one of the valve games first, hl2, portal etc then try validating mgsv again.

It should say 1 file needs to be redownloaded, so go to steam downloads and make sure that happens.

Installation:
------------------------------
Use SnakeBite Mod Manager 0.8.3 or later:
Get 0.8 from nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/106/
And use snakebites in-app update system.

Uninstall any earlier version of Infinite Heaven
Install Infinite Heaven.msgv

WARNING: Applying this mod to any game version after the one stated at the top of the readme involved will likely prevent the game from working. Simply uninstall using SnakeBite and wait for the mod to be updated.

NOTE: Snakebite sometimes has issues after game updates, to reset snakebite choose it's Settings > Restore Original files, confirm snakebite.xml was deleted in your MGS_TPP folder, then revalidate the game cache in steam and reinstall the mod.

Using alongside other mods:
------------------------------
Infinite Heaven modifies a lot of the core game lua scripts, if other mods that have their own versions of those files will break things in either obvious or subtle ways.
Mods that shouldn't have a conflict with Infinite Heaven are: Model swaps, data table mods like development unlocks or times.
Ask the mod author for a snakebite install or use makebite (comes with snakebite) to convert the mod if it provides lua files.
If you want to manually check to see if a mod conflicts unzip the Infinite Heaven .mgsv with the zip tool of your choice and check to see if any of the files match files in the other mod.

Uninstallation:
------------------------------
Exit any missions, return to the ACC.
The mod saves some varables to the save file, but on initial testing (I welcome feedback on this) there is no issue with loading a save from this mod after the mod has been removed (provided you have exited to ACC)
Use uninstall in SnakeBite.

Usage:
------------------------------
While in ACC Heli (full menu), or in-mission (small menu)
Hold <Quick dive> (space key or X button on controller) for a second to toggle the mod menu when in the ACC or in-mission.

Use either Arrow keys or Dpad to navigate the menu.
Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open submenu.

Press <Change Stance> button to go to previous menu.

Press <Call> button to reset current setting.

Tap mod menu button <Quick dive> while menu is open to refresh current setting.

Known issues:
The Announce Log used for the display has a delay on entries, so slow down your button presses when changing the settings.

Replaying sideop 144, Remains of Man on Fire, will leave your character stuck in the Quarantine helipad and unable to abort the mission and requiring you to restore your save. Avoid completing the mission (extracting body).

Starting a mission with subsistence will still show the loadout screen, and will show the last missions visual setup,
it should refresh when you change any settings, or if you exit to the title menu, or just enter the mission.

Buddy may have to be repicked after turning off subsidence.

Turning off subsistence pure will still prevent you from selecting buddy, exiting to title and back might fix it, entering a mission will.

Enemy Life percentage doesn't seem to effect stun.

Subsidence mode will still technically do a full deployment cost of what's set. Manual solution, have a loadout with all items set to none and cheapest weapons.

When changing General Enemy Parameters back to Default you must exit to title to have the setting save, then restart the game to have it load the default enemy parameters.

Vehicle reinforcements:
Currently if the heli leaves the reinforce variable will stay active so you will not have further vehicle reinforcements for the mission.
Reinforce heli will spawn with combat alert, you'll hear the ! and it doing a round of attack even though it's far away.

Changelog:
------------------------------
r135 - 2015-03-05 - public release
Wildard soldiers: Number of soldiers incread to #Cps/5, number of females increased to 2.
mbDontDemoDisableOcelot removed.
Option: mbEnableOcelot - runs an update function to enable/warp and set a route for ocelot on motherbase
Decreased alphaDistance on free cam to 0.1, should be able to get closer to character without them fading out.

r134
veh_rl_*.fpkd/*fox2 - bodyInstances,attachmentInstanceCount increased to 4. 1 - player vehicle + 2 (quests max) + 1 patrol. See modfpk.txt
Blockquests: removed armor vehicle quest block on vehicle patrol
Regression: Patrol vehicle spawn type random to level seed
Refactor: TppEnemyFova> break out WildCardFova
Added full range of female faces to wildcard females

r133 - 2015-03-01 
Fix: Head markers off did not work on heli entry - thanks washtubs for the report.
Option: disableWorldMarkers - thanks brunovisk114 for the suggestion
In mission menu: playerRestrictionsInMissionMenu
MB suit male: SOVIET_ALL, PF_AlL

r132
Patrols setup refactor - shifted to OnInitializeTop, all now modify the missionTable scripts directly since they are unloaded/reloaded anyway.
AddToLrrp split into ModifyPatrolVehicleSoldiers, AddLrrp
Option: enableWildCardFreeRoam
Wildcard - added weapon and body tables, AddWildCard, decided to just replace existing soldier due to: Adding soldiers being unreliable, will allow me to add feature to all missions without having to add extra soldiers to fox2s (assuming I can do it in a way that doesn't interfere with mission critical soldiers).
Free mission .sdfs: add other soldier soundbanks


r131 - 2015-02-22 - public release
Fix: Hang of FOB all load, thanks SoullessMadness for the report. FOB defense hang on load unconfirmed since it's hard to test.
Vehicle Patrols: Improved soldier assignment, Soldier assigned from reserve pool to fill rnd min(2,vehicleSeats),vehicleSeats (seats defined in base vehicle info), soldier already assigned above seat count get put into pool.
Gives more variation, allows jeeps to have up to 4 people, fixes sillyness with tanks stopping, dropping off a dude, then attacking.
NOTE: all other vehicles than crash on setrelativevehicle if soldiers assigned > 2. APCs carrying are handled differently.
Also hits the same non realize bug as below, soldiers do sometimes finally realize. Vehicle will initially drive off as if it's full, but if soldier realizes will wait till soldier reaches it an gets in.
Don't know if it's something due to my method of warping to soldiers for testing.
Changed from saving/restoring vehicle type enum from svar to random by same seed, vehicle basicType is stored in mvar.
Options: lrrpSizeFreeRoam min, max, disabled for now to get decent coverage

r130
Option: mbPrioritizeFemale, by default the game tries to put a minimum of 2 female DD on that cluster (from that cluster), MAX bumps it to MAX_STAFF_NUM_ON_CLUSTER, so basicall all the females you have, does not include Command cluster, None clears the staff selection of females
Option: mbDDSuitFemale, extendedparts does work independently so was relatively painless
More options for DD Suit, Soviet berets, hoodies, PF misc, using the unique quest/mission bodies from missions/quests.

r129
Fix: Missing Tpp.IsUav, kjp decided to add this at some point even though there's an identical IsUAV. May fix the incorrect or unregistered fob fulton task types.
Option: enableLrrpFreeRoam - bunch of soldier locators added to free roam fox2s which are assigned a cp(lrrp) and a travelplan between two randomly chosen bases.
Some odd things: Setting to coppied travelplans often causes soldier to not realize (even with force enable and realize), adding too many copied travelplans to the mission luas breaks the normal vehicle lrrps (soliers still spawn but thy wont get in vehicle)

r128 - 2015-02-11 - public release
Expanded mbDDSuit to Xof, Soviet a/b, PF a/b/c
ddBodyInfo extended to include soldiersubtype, hasHeadgear renamed helmetOnly, noDDHeadgear, hasHelmet, hasFace to allow various combinations of dd headgear and model gear.
f30050_npc: add reinforce_block scriptblock
add more corpse game objects, mother base only had 2, interesting note: also corpse system seems keeps one in reserve or something
vox_f30050.sdf - soundbank load refs for enemy_af/mafr/zombie added
mbts_enemy, override soldiertype depending on GetCurrentDDBodyInfo
GetSoldierType, GetSubsoldier - override depending on currentddbody
mbEnableLethal - enable lethal actions on motherbase
mbEnableFultonAddStaff
mbNonStaff - also no demon points increase on mbnonstaff kills
No game over on soldier die in mother base when mbwargames and enablelethal
disableCamText
mbWarGames->mbWarGamesProfile, toggling some of above, the individual settings are currently non-user facing.

r127
Percentage floats changed to int, will fall into uint8/16, saves save file space
Fix: SetPercentagePowersRange using orphaned/prior name of SetMinMax, since it was called by revengeConfigProfile.WIDE it's likely that it wouldnt set its subsettings.
Fix: Custom enemy prep clear armor if it can't be used.
Custom config bypass some (config wide) combination restrictions, namely shield and missile, shotgun and mg in same config.
Made allowmissileweapon combo actually work, and not just allow assault, decided to not allow with mg though

r126
Camera refactor:
Cam edit mode and current cam split.
Player cams for each stance/move mode
Ivars for cam variables. This is where I seem to have hit the save file limit, no, just unrelated varables acting odd as if forgotten or overflowed.
Research/deminification of TppSave and other save functions, bumping the save size for the mission category is likely to be a reciepie for disaster since it combines categories in one file and it's smack in the middle of some. Looks like I could add my own save file if I could add a category, but categories ar pow2 and max is at 255 suggesting there's no room even if it would just accept the field from lua/not require it in exe, or it would be if mgo category didn't fit into this scheme, but then that's only defined in mgo exe.

r125
Refactor InfMenuDefs, on table build adds reset settings and go back items
Fix: Mb cutscene time using hour setting for minute.
Split Enemy use DD equipment into Free roam and Missions
Fix: noOnChangeSub also blocking OnChange for profiles - basically any profile that set other profiles was broken.
Fix: Wormhole disable was reversed, also renamed to Wormhole Level since it's the same implementation as Fulton Level
Option: soldierHearingDistScale

r124 - 2015-01-30 - public release
mbWargames: Zombie mode - mixes regular puppet and msf.
Options: disableRetry, gameOverOnDiscovery - to replicate total stealth settings

r123
InfButton: some bitmasks added/renamed to proper from lua, don't seem to be in the playerpad section in the exe though
Refactor InfMenu refresh current setting now combined with Activate (ACTION key)
MenuOn/Off() -> OnActivate OnDeactivate
Activate/deactivate checks > CheckActivate
revengeModeForMb check moved out of IsNoRevengeMission to selectrevengetype itself so it doesnt cause any revenge points change.
Refactor
Added free cam mode, similar implmentation to warp mode but disabling normal controls via padmask to open up keys for own use.
Menu open equip disableActionFlag now bit flipping instead of just saving/restoring previous. Still have odd issues when trying to mix with multiple disables (with free cam for example) seemingly flipping unrelated flags.
Update-ivars now (manually in Onchange) call an OnActivate/Deactivate, key repeat settings shifted there instead of in update.


r122 - 2015-01-23 - public release
Headmarkers should remain disabled in all situations, hopefully - thanks Psithen for the report
Refactor: blocking quests due to reinforcement and patrol vehicle settings via unlockSideOpNumber and TppQuest.UpdateActiveQuest unified to InfMain.BlockQuest. unlockSideOpNumber now silently skips.
"ACTIVE_DECOY","GUN_CAMERA" added to custom config
Mb wargames non-lethal extended to custom config.

r121
Option: revengeModeForMb - "Mother base prep mode" - "Off","FOB style","Enemy prep levels","Custom prep"
Options: mbDemoOverrideTime, mbDemoOverrideWeather - thanks qwertyuiop1234567899 for the suggestion
Various renames to solidify terms:
Subsistence Mode renamed Subsistence profile to match other uses of the term in the menu, and since that's what the varable has been named for months lol.
Free mode to Free roam, mode should be a term reserved for specific behaviour, possibly with multiple settings.
Profile is a curated set of option settings.

r120
Option: enableSoldiersWithVehicleReinforce
IsDDBodyEquip to make body/headgear independant from mbSoldierEquipGrade
Refactor: MinMaxIvar for creating such paired ivars.
Refactor: mbSoldierEquipGrade split to min, max, changed to grade value 1-10
Option: allowUndevelopedDDEquip
Options: enableMbDDEquip, enableEnemyDDEquip, replace mbSoldierEquipGrade 0/OFF, drives IsDDEquip
Option: enableEnemyDDEquip - overrides weaponIdTable with DD

r119 - 2015-01-17 - public release
Ivars - subName, PushMin, PushMax to handle adjusting paired ivars.
Reworking of custom prep menu order and item names.

r118
Change remove demon to subtract demon points, less ideal since there's no feedback of current value so cant tell the lower bounds, but it works for people the prior method didn't - thanks drkcrstl for the feedback
Custom prep profile with wide,max,min, max replaces prior revenge level based max.
SetCustomRevengeUiParameters as rough indication of custom prep config.

r117
InfMenu: support for function call OnActivate when pressing action on selected option.
Reasearch into Player.ChangeEquip
Test of quiet humming command, result: only for boss quiet game object, sad.
Welcome message added for entering acc from title.

Custom revenge config: WIP most individual revenge config settings settable
Refactor: A number of gvar instead of ivar references missed in the prior refactor
Disallow menu if in carboard box

r116 - 2015-12-30 - public release
Un-fixed a Retail bug, the game is apparently relying on it's broken behavior lol. Manifested as: Some end of cutscene loadscreen hangs, prologue/truth post heli hallway non-trigger. Possibly much more.

r115 - 2015-12-27 - public release
Fix: AddPowerSetting, was trashing it by using same name in two variables, the perils of deminification. Possibly affected fob soldier settings.
Powersettings to DD headgear
Load screen splashes reverted to base game. Kjp did too much voodoo in respect to the Nvidia splash screen for me to be happy with touching it.

r114
Refactor: complete ivar get, removed fobs reset settings - instead returns off/default on ivar access.
Refactor: mbDDsuit - pull various body setup data to single table ddBodyInfo and reference that

r113
Regression fix: in mission menu when on buddy (horse,walker) - thanks Crotaro for report
Refactor: ivar get via ivar functions instead of gvar value (started, not yet complete)
Option: revengeProfile, default, heaven - to manage the profusion of revenge ivars
Option: enableMgVsShotgunVariation
Option: randomizeSmallCpPowers

r112
Options: disableMissionsWeaponRestriction, disableMotherbaseWeaponRestriction -> revenge CANNOT_USE_ALL_WEAPON_MISSION

Refactor: InfMenu. Next/PrevSetting/ChangeSetting. Support <ivar>.GetNext(), <ivar>.GetSettingText()

r108
Vehicle patrols changed to using releif vehicle(player vehicle) fpks
Option: allowHeadGearCombo - calculates cp config a second time with headgear combinations allowed.
Option: balanceHeadGear - adjust

r107
Option: vehiclePatrolPackType, switches between quest packs and custom fpks - thanks blejky for the report

r106 - 2015-12-14 - public release
ig_*.fpk/ fpkd. Initially started as copies of the respective quests I was using to get proper vehicle references for patrol vehicles, since using the quest fpks directly intereferes with quests - still not exactly sure what aspect, guessing the quest script block load given it went away when I deleted it, but tests showed the script itself wasn't loaded, so guessing the script block entity in the fox2 got engaged, don't know.
Stripping down the packs further revealed some troublesome issues with fox2 files relying on specifc file orders, or possibly something more.
Fix: (due to above) vehicle patrols interfering with sideops - thanks blejky for the report

r105
Fix: Reset all settings was completely broken, varable but didnt cat all instances woops.
Options: applyPowersToOuterBase, applyPowersToLlrp.

r104
Options: allowHeavyArmorInFreeMode, allowHeavyArmorInAllMissions - currently armor has the same bug as mb armor where hits act like the armor isnt there, still same shots as non armor and no spang sounds of bullets hitting armor.
Options:
fultonSuccessMenu="Fulton success menu"

Fix: Vehicle patrol all of one type loading hang - thanks mgs5tppfan for the report

r102 - 2015-12-09 - public release
Commands: setDemon, removeDemon - thanks PIESOFTHENORTH for the suggestion
Refactor: Removed Item suffix from non menu item names.
Fix: patrol vehicle enable types not rebuilding enabled list.
Research options:
vehiclePatrolClass
vehiclePatrolPaintType
vehiclePatrolEmblemType
SetPatrolSpawnInfo, revert to default/unmodified painttype, currently only jeeps and trucks using.
Fix: forceSuperReinforce out of bounds
Disabled random emblem splashes to see if it's cause of various reported issues.

r101 - 2015-12-09 - public release
Fix: xraymarkers
Fix: A case of the Display menu not showing for some saves, possibly had other ramifications.

r100 - 2015-12-08 - public release
vehicle patrol vehicle type saving - svar array vehiclePatrolSpawnedTypes, ModifyVehicleSpawn split into PreSpawnVehicle, RestoreVehiclePatrol, ModifyVehicleSpawn
A few iterations till I got this right, was a gvar with a custom clear function, mission svar seems the better way to go though.

r99
vehicleBaseTypes/ModifyVehicleSpawn refactored to select from ivars/location.
Options:
vehiclePatrolDistribution - off, singular, each
vehiclePatrolLvEnable
vehiclePatrolTruckEnable
vehiclePatrolWavEnable
vehiclePatrolWavHeavyEnable
vehiclePatrolTankEnable

r98
InfMain vehicleSpawnInfoTable initial thrash out, ModifyVehicleSpawn() to intercept TppEnemy.SpawnVehicle
Research: None of the fpks you'd expect - COMMON_whatever vehicle, or even reinforce fpks - actually seem to have full references/setup whatever of the mentioned vehicles, quest fpks do however. Built list of fpks for vehicle types.
Fixes to force reinforce I inadvertantly introduced when cleaning up.

r97
Fix: <Stance> in support heli not setting pull out in mother base
Feature: <Stance> in support heli now a (non saving) toggle for pull-out, requires you to jump out after setting hold though.
Option: Start on foot reworked to spawn at selected lz on mother base platforms - thanks to NasaNhak for pointer
Feature: Abort to Heli from title continue. Hold down ESCAPE for 1.5 seconds, the kjp logo will flash, clickin on continue will load ACC instead of continuing mission.
Research: Vehicle swap. Vehicle spawning seems pretty loose, the issue is the assets/fpk loading.

r96
OnTimer_FinishReinforce firing on reinforce heli LostControl and reinforce vehicle VehicleBroken, resets heavy reinforce so it can retrigger
heliReinforceChance changed to switch enableHeliReinforce, will revisit if I get vehicle reinforcement more consistant
Disable super reinforce in free till can figure it out.
Option: forceReinforceRequest
Known Bug: Reinforce heli will spawn with combat alert, you'll hear the ! and it doing a round of attack even though it's far away.
Option: disableReinforceHeliPullOut, currently have no way to tell if heli has left so cant reset reinforce if it has, this at least removes one case

r95
Fix: turn off menu when in ground vehicle
Option: soldierAlertOnHeavyVehicleDamage - changes phase of soldiers CP on damage, independant from Ivars.phaseUpate
printPhaseChanges - now via message, so independant from Ivars.phaseUpate, includes cpid and prevPhase, spams a bit more though.
Option: useSoldierForDemos now covers allowing selected character in Diamond Dogs and Shining Lights missions - thanks NasaNhak and Solidcal for the suggestions.
InfMenuDefs: useSoldierForDemos also added to playerSettingsMenu
Fix: Mission timer on Backup Back Down (10054,11054) would not start, startOnFoot now SetIsStartFromFreePlay - thanks NasaNhak the report.
Fix: changing subsistence profile would flip it to Custom via unsupressed onsubsettingchanged.
Tonne of deminification

r94
Option: WIP: forceVehicleReinforce, heliReinforceChance - heli reinforcment initially working, vehicles aparently have a lot of setup in the engine I'm missing out on, but work for some actual missions not in the usual reinforce mission list.
InfMain: support for game message system - Messages(), OnMessage(), Init and Reload build messageExecTable
Refactor: various settings/functions called in Tpp* message functions now via infmain messages.
playerHealthScale (and enemyhealtscale) reduced to 900%, hit some odd overflow/wrap limit I think.

r93
Player and enemy health scale option upper bounds increased to 1000%
Fix: Use selected soldier in cutscenes should catch all of them now - thanks VickoStojanov for the report.
Message added to headgear to make clearer it only works for DD soliders - thanks gOKU1983 for the report.
Fix: not being able to select weapon when toggling warp mode.
Fix: returning to ACC while in vehicle or on buddy preventing mod menu from opening.
Research: vehicle reinforcement, various things blocking the way, a mission list check, surprisingly few missions used it, quest helis actually use part of the system, and the actual vehicle reinforce setup isn't called in free mode.

r92 - 2015-11-25 - public release
Thought I was done with heli? Ho ho.
UpdateHeli > manually open door on mission start by pressing <STANCE>, a fun combo is to set 'Mission start open door wait time' to a max and just ride in first person, then pop out whenever you want.
Start missions on foot shifted to support heli menu.
NOTE: Aparently DisablePullOut overrides the motherbase taxi service, use the <STANCE> to disable then hit the usual <EVADE> to open the taxi menu
Option: setSearchLightForcedHeli - ok really Disable search light, but the ivar name is closer to command name
Order recieved announclog for a couple of heli settings.

r91
disableHeliAttack - switch via OnChange, so now can update in-mission,
activation block in TppMain.Oninitialize now InfMain.UpdateHeliVars
Option: setInvincibleHeli
Option: DisablePullOut
Command: PullOut
Feature: Force heli pull-out by pressing STANCE while in heli.
Various other heli commands explored that turned out not useful.
InfMain.SplashStateCallback_r, tying in with RandomEmblemSplash to have splashes cover the load period (like the original splashes did that I rashly killed lol), splashes do not block loading, there is a hit however long the splash texture load is though.
title_sequence - kills off the current random splash, title_sequence usually wait for the normal splashes (that I removed), but in practice they were usually done by then (so I can't really claim any loading speed improvement) and I think the nvidia splash was added to cover the rest.

r90
Splash screens added to start/end of start.lua, end one is a good indicator that the main luas have loaded/compiled ok and from that point on its onto init mission/init_squence
InfMain.DeleteSplash
InfMain.RandomEmblemSplash
Refactor: InfMain.Update > ExecUpdate - phaseUpdate and warpPlayerUpdate using unified update system.
Ivar: enablePhaseMod renamed phaseUpdate - users will have to redo their setting

r89
Refactor:InfSoldierParams, soldierParamsProfile, soldierHealthScale - various renaming, shifting block out of TppMain
Option: soldierSightDistScale
Options: *DistScaleSightParam - incomplete, still don't know the approach to take here, there's a heck of a lot of settings in SoldierParameterTables, how granular do I want to let the user mod this? scale vs exact value? managing profiles (something closer to TPPHC)?
Command: printSightFormParameterItem
Command: printhealthTableParameterItem
Fix: Refresh current setting (tapping mod menu button) not checking if it was an actual setting (menu) (would do no harm only wanring message, I knew I put it there for a reason)
Project: MockTest - why didn't I think of this sooner.
Ivar.enemyPrameters renamed soldierParamsProfile, now a profile to soldierHealthMult(also renamed) and  soldierSightDistScale

r88
Fix: Menu off when iDroid open improved
Ivars: Is/OptionIsSetting catch case of no enum
IsDefault added
OnSubSettingChanged - doesnt flip profile if subsetting is default or profile is default or custom
Option: defaultHeliDoorOpenTime
InfMain.Update - common execution check flags expanded, passed to the various mod feature update functions
Option:quietRadioMode

r87
Command: warpPlayerMode
Refactor: InfMenu.EndFadeIn, FinishOpeningDemoOnHeli - pull in stuff from TppMission msgs
Option: disableXrayMark - buddies that mark still cause the effect though.
InfMenuDef allTables setup check IfTable
Equip menu disabled on menu open -- playerWarpMode messes with it though
ButtonRepeat enabled on navigate up/down menu.
Should improve the experience a bit for gamepad bros.
InfMenu - disable state extended from menus to all options

r86 - 2015-11-19 - public release
Fix: A few cutscenes I broken in r56, oops
Fix: mbDontDemoDisableOcelot dont disable occelot on cutscene hanging cutscene end

- thanks TheChosenOne896 for the reports
Option: mbDontDemoDisableBuddy
Option: mbDontDemoDisableOcelot expanded to more cases
Fix: remebered to update in-game version string lol

r85 - 2015-11-19 - public release
Fix: osp weapon settings only set if profile not default - temporary fix for empty magazines on mission start (will still happen with individual osp settings though)
Fix: some unexposed appearence settings running on set-to-default, manifested as player changing to snake, olive drab on FOB.
Fix: fulton being set to level 1 on mission start
- thanks GaKoDuck for the reports

r84
Refactor: InfMain.Update - Phase mod broken to own function, InfButton.UpdateHeld(),InfButton.UpdatePressed() shifted from InfMenu.Update, InfMenu.Update now called from InfMain.Update instead of TppMain.
Refactor: DebugPrint split and print strings larger than Announcelog limit
Command: warpPlayerCommand - just initial testing with hard coded positions.
Command: Unlock weapon customisation - game progression unlock
Command: Exting unlock player avatar changed from Ivar to command - not that there's much difference, the deliniation is ivar is it's own setting, and almost always saved, command does a thing, and doesn't care about it's own state, in this case we're just setting another game var.
Fix: Phase mod disabled for mother base. MB is not set up for caution routes aparently, also even with friendly set they will go hostil on alert

r83
clockTimeScale upper bound increased
Option: telopMode - Disable mission intro credits
Side project: scraper for langId dictionary

r82
mbLayout - research, not much result, mostly used for fob missions I think, doesn't seem to be any actual geometry changes.
manualMissionCode,loadMissionItem - not much use, the 'no number missions' are supposed to be hard versions of some missions, but I see no evidence that they actually have custom changes.

r81
Extend mbEnableBuddies to Zoo
Zoo plants should repop.

r80 - 2015-11-17 - public release

r75 - 2015-11-14 - public release
Fix: subsistence mission without subsistence profile set hang on loading screen

Option: Don't lock goal doors. Useless unless you like swishing doors.
Option: Don't disable Ocelot after cutscenes - with this you can leave Occelot on mb in person after some cutscenes.

r72
Fixed: enemies secondary not being set
ModStart to Init, no longer run each Update
Shifted lua file references into the Tpp.lua requires system, in line with how tpp does it. start.lua now unmoddified.

disableBuddies - not currently user facing

r68
Ivars: Setting/getting via .Set, Is, Above, BelowOrIs...
Ivars: settingsTable for custom function per setting, either run on setting change, or value return via ivar.data()
Ivars: SubSetting>parent profile OnSubSettingChanged, just notifies user and sets profile to CUSTOM. Too much effort to do subsettings combination validation for now.
Option: ospWeaponLoadout now ospWeaponProfile with the original Pure, Secondary
Subsettings: to ospWeaponLoadout - primary/secondary/tertiaryWeaponOsp

r67
Command: showequipgrade
InfHooks added, test out another to keep my impact on other files minimized, though at this point with no other substantial mods and it being unlikely that there will be many more patches I don't know why.
