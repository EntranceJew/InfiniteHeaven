IH menu item type indicators change:
Option = Setting
Menu >
Command >>
Command that closes menu when done >]

Command: Support heli to latest marker - Requests Support heli to Landing Zone closest to the last placed user marker. 
Can also be used to ride the support heli to another LZ if the IH menu is open and the option is selected when getting into the heli. This however has an issue where the doors will close on take-off preventing you from shifting between heli sides, the chaingun on your side can still be used however.

Disclaimer:
------------------------------
Use the mod at you own risk (which can be mitigated by backing up saves and files replaced by mod)
This mod is still largely untested, detailed feedback at Nexus page welcome.

Installation

Usage:
------------------------------

Infinite Heaven menu:

While in ACC Heli (full menu), or in-mission (small menu)
Hold <Quick dive> (space key or X button on controller) for 2 seconds to toggle the mod menu when in the ACC or in-mission.

The menu system will display the current
[Option name] - [Setting value or description]
Sub-menus are indicated by >

Use either Arrow keys or Dpad to navigate the menu.
Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open sub menu.

The size/step of the setting change can be made bigger/smaller by holding <Ready weapon> or <Fire>. 

Press <Binoculars> button to reset current setting.

Press <Reload> button to set the current setting to it's minimum.
Press <Change stance> button to go to previous menu.

By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via infinite heavens in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.
