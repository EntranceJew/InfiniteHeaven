Recent changes/additions
------------------------------
NOTE: Remember to exit back to ACC before upgrading Infinite Heaven, upgrading a save that's mid mission is likely to cause issues.

New for r184
Fixed: Quick menu should not activate if holding a quick menu command button then holding the quick menu on button(CALL), will only be activated on quick menu on button(CALL) held then pressing a quick menu command button - thanks LucrassKelvac for your report.
I'm aware some people will still have issue with how quick menu is activated, depending on how they play. Quick menu will be much more configurable in comming version.

New for r183
Fixed: Infinite load screen on traveling between free<>mission for some missions - thanks RealQi for the save file.

New for r182
Fixed: Being unable to ready weapon when all Custom equip options are turned on and prep config has all weapons set - thanks Gambchon for the report and save file.
Option: Force enable Quaranine platform soldiers - in the normal game the Qurantine platform soldiers are disabled once you capture Skulls. This option re-enables them.
(via Mother Base menu)
Added: IH visit morale support for Quarantine plat.
Added: Suit support for Quarantine plat.
Added: Custom soldier equip for Quarantine plat - if you have been using the 'MB staff use custom equip' you will have to set it again this version as the update has reset it.
Added: Skulls attack support for Quarantine plat - no seperate option, uses 'Enable Skull attacks in Free roam'. Alternatively can be triggered by attacking captured Skulls in the cells.
Exposed: mbEnableLethalActions - Allow lethal actions - Enables lethal weapons and actions on Mother Base. You will still get a game over if you kill staff.
(via Mother Base menu)

Usage:
------------------------------

Infinite Heaven menu:

While in ACC Heli (full menu), or in-mission (small menu)
Hold <Quick dive> (space key or X button on controller) for 2 seconds to toggle the mod menu when in the ACC or in-mission.

The menu system will display the current
[Option name] - [Setting value or description]
Sub-menus are indicated by >
Command >>
Command that closes menu when done >]
[Option Name] <Action> - Selected is applied by pressing <Action> 

Use either Arrow keys or Dpad to navigate the menu.
Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open sub menu.

The size/step of the setting change can be made bigger/smaller by holding <Ready weapon> or <Fire>. 

Press <Binoculars> button to reset current setting.

Press <Reload> button to set the current setting to it's minimum.
Press <Change Stance> button to go to previous menu.

By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via infinite heavens in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.

QuickMenu:
- A way to quickly trigger certain Infinite Heaven commands.

Hold down <Call>(Q or Left bumper) and press:

<Binoculars>(F or Right bumper) to toggle the IH main menu

In mission Quick Menu:
<Ready weapon>(Right mouse or Left Trigger) to warp to last placed usermarker
<Fire>(Left mouse or Right Trigger) to open the menu to heli-to last usermarker (a kludge, but nessesary to activate the inter landingzone ride on heli)
<Action>(E key or Y button) to activate TSM
<Reload>(R key or B button) to activate Free cam
<Dash>(Shift or Left stick click) to activate Static camera
<Change Stance>(C key or A button) to have Quiet move to last usermarker

Profiles:
Profiles are lists of settings for IH options, can be used as an alternative, or in conjunction with IHs in-game menu.
See InfProfiles Readme and InfProfiles.lua for further info.
