New for 145:
Updated to MGSV 1.081
Feature: Heli patrols in free roam - "None","Min","Mid",Max","Enemy prep" - number of helis.
Up to seven attack helis will patrol free roam.
Updated: Attack heli type: Added Default, Enemy prep
"Enemy prep" setting will try and scale those options to your current enemy preparedness level.

Know issues:
Heli state is not saved and will reset on checkpoint reload, so helis may vanish (to another place on the map).
This may be mitigated in future versions, but not fully fixed since KJP optimized a bit too far so can only save/load one heli.
Heli in side ops may travel from one sideop to the next (if first sideop is loaded and second is also heli sideop), have yet to test to see if it does switch the sideop it counts towards on death.
Heli sideop loading may be delayed until very near resulting in sudden pop in of sideop vehicles/soldiers.


Free cam update:
Can now move cam horizontally while in vertical mode.
Added move speed scale adjust mode via DASH
Move scale min decreased, max increased

Start on foot update:
Added: "Start free roam on foot","Start missions on foot","Start Mother base on foot"
With: "Off","All but assault LZs","All Lzs" - thanks NasaNhak for the idea

Change: Hand levels min to 0, this will allow disabling of Sonar - thanks vollmerej1 for the suggestion.
Added "Default" to mother base "Attack heli type" - thanks NasaNhak for the idea
Added "Support and Attack helis" to "Enable npc helis"

Fixed: Manually opening support heli door on mission start being conflated with disablePullOutHeli
Fixed: Enemy phase options should now work in Wargames.


Disclaimer:
------------------------------
Use the mod at you own risk (which can be mitigated by backing up saves and files replaced by mod)
This mod is still largely untested, detailed feedback at Nexus page welcome.

Installation
------------------------------
http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/articles/2/

Usage:
------------------------------

While in ACC Heli (full menu), or in-mission (small menu)
Hold <Quick dive> (space key or X button on controller) for 2 seconds to toggle the mod menu when in the ACC or in-mission.

The menu system will display the current
<Option name> - <Setting value or description>
Sub-menus are indicated by >>

Use either Arrow keys or Dpad to navigate the menu.
Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open sub menu.

Press <Change Stance> button to go to previous menu.

Press <Call> button to reset current setting.

Tap mod menu button <Quick dive> while menu is open to refresh current setting.

By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via infinite heavens in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.
