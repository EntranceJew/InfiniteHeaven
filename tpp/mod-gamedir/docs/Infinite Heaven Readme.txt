Feature: "Quiet move to last marker" - sets a position similar to the Quiet attack positions, but can be nearly anywhere.
Quiet will still abort from that position if it's too close to enemies.
(In In game menu > User markers menu)

Option: "Allow Enemy Prep shift after free roam" - by default enemy prep only changes in response to actual missions, this option allows enemy prep changes to be applied after leaving Free roam (but not via abort), 
(In Enemy prep menu > Prep system menu)

Update: "Staff-wide morale boost for good visit" now gets bonus for in game visit length, currently 3 in game days, so break out that cigar.

Feature: "Enemy prep decrease on long MB visit" - using the same system as above, spend some in-game days during a mother base visit and enemy prep levels will decrease on leaving.
currently reduces after 3 days (stacking), reduces the same as checken hat 
(In Enemy prep menu > Prep system menu)

New for r148:
Fixed: DDog on mother base wont stop following past start cluster.

Wildcard soldiers:
Number of wild card soldiers increased
Removed 0 fulton sucess

Feature IH Interrogation: Add some interrogations to soldiers:
Travel plan of foot patrol
Location of wild card soldier
Inter CP quest: Sets up pairs of soldiers in different cps, interrogating one will give CP of other, interrogating him will give a reward of unprocessed resources (around a couple of containers worth) or a skull soldier/parasite on the next extraction (reaching checkpoint etc)

Added Sub menu: Mother base menu > Show characters menu - Enable ocelot shifted from mb menu, others shifted from Show assets menu.
Feature: Show characters menu > Reset Paz - Resets Paz state to beginning

Feature: Mother base menu > "Staff-wide morale boost for good visit" - Gives a staff-wide morale boost on having a number of soldiers salute (most of a cluster), or visiting a number of clusters (with at least one salute on each). Must exit via heli for it to apply.
Update: Mother base morale boost points now stack, both for visiting several clusters and having many soldiers salute.


Disclaimer:
------------------------------
Use the mod at you own risk (which can be mitigated by backing up saves and files replaced by mod)
This mod is still largely untested, detailed feedback at Nexus page welcome.

Installation
------------------------------
[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/articles/2/]http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/articles/2/[/url]

Usage:
------------------------------

While in ACC Heli (full menu), or in-mission (small menu)
Hold <Quick dive> (space key or X button on controller) for 2 seconds to toggle the mod menu when in the ACC or in-mission.

The menu system will display the current
<Option name> - <Setting value or description>
Sub-menus are indicated by >>

Use either Arrow keys or Dpad to navigate the menu.
Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open sub menu.

Press <Change Stance> button to go to previous menu.

Press <Call> button to reset current setting.

Tap mod menu button <Quick dive> while menu is open to refresh current setting.

By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via infinite heavens in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.
