Recent changes/additions
------------------------------
NOTE: Remember to exit back to ACC before upgrading Infinite Heaven, upgrading a save that's mid mission is likely to cause issues.

Features and Options html file in the Infinite Heaven zip for a better formatted and linked version of the features list.

IH menu item type indicators change:
Option = Setting
Menu >
Command >>
Command that closes menu when done >]

Command: Support heli to latest marker - Requests Support heli to Landing Zone closest to the last placed user marker. 
Can also be used to ride the support heli to another LZ if the IH menu is open and the option is selected when getting into the heli. This however has an issue where the doors will close on take-off preventing you from shifting between heli sides, the chaingun on your side can still be used however.

New for r162

Change: Vehicle classes apply to non patrol vehicles (Afgh only)
Fixed: Random CP subtype now resets table if not enabled for mode.
Fixed: Returned molotok to wildcard soldiers, had accidentally replaced it with the high grade DD fob rifle.

Option: Randomize minefield mine types - Randomizes the types of mines within a minfield from the default anti-personel mine to gas, anti-tank, electromagnetic

Option: Enable additional minefields - In the game many bases have several mine fields but by default only one is enabled at a time, this option lets you enable all of them. Still relies on enemy prep level to be high enough for minefields to be enabled.

Option: Disable Intel team herb spotting (requires game restart) - Since the variable is only read once on game startup this setting requires a game restart before it will activate/deactivate. (via Player restrictions menu)

Option: Equipment on trucks - Puts a random piece of equipment on the back of patrol trucks.
(via Patrol vehicles menu)

Disclaimer:
------------------------------
Use the mod at you own risk (which can be mitigated by backing up saves and files replaced by mod)
This mod is still largely untested, detailed feedback at Nexus page welcome.

Installation
------------------------------
See: Installation.txt file in the Infinite Heaven .zip 
or
[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/articles/2/]http://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/articles/2/[/url]

Usage:
------------------------------

While in ACC Heli (full menu), or in-mission (small menu)
Hold <Quick dive> (space key or X button on controller) for 2 seconds to toggle the mod menu when in the ACC or in-mission.

The menu system will display the current
<Option name> - <Setting value or description>
Sub-menus are indicated by >>

Use either Arrow keys or Dpad to navigate the menu.
Up/Down to select option.
Left/Right to change setting or open sub menu.

Press <Change Stance> button to go to previous menu.

Press <Call> button to reset current setting.

Tap mod menu button <Quick dive> while menu is open to refresh current setting.

By design I try to keep the initial install to all regular game settings and only changed via infinite heavens in-game mod menu.
All settings are reset to off on doing a FOB mission. But I suggest you play offline while the mod is installed. Snakebite mod manager allows easy toggling of mods.
