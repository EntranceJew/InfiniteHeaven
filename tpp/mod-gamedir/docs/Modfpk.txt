f30050_item
bumped up light vehicle instances from 4 to 12
added 12 more vehicle locators (veh_ih_00nn)


\chunk1_dat\Assets\tpp\pack\vehicle\veh_rl_*.fpkd/*fox2 - bodyInstances,attachmentInstanceCount increased to 4. 1 - player vehicle + 2 (quests max) + 1 patrol? Should I make that 2?
These packs are actually for the player vehicle but I'm loading them to get the patrol vehicles to work, the veh_mc* packs in common don't actually have ready-to-go data definitions. Editing data is falling into 'not default by default' behaviour which I don't really like, but there's not many options. In the past I tried rolling my own packs but there's issues with fpkds with fox2s (can see this by unpacking an fpkd changing the gztool file pack xml order and repacking) that lead to crashes or extreme memory leaks (like several gb of memory in a minute).


Bunch of extra soldier locators in free mission fox2s


f30050_heli.fox2 added westheli, westheli usually has it's own fox2 but the custom fpkd issue still remains.

added enemyheli
