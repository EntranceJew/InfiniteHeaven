--tex reconstructed file type order from analysing output of this process.
--all positions reletively solid except for "bnd", analysis from my ExtensionOrder.lua puts it somewhere between veh and tgt. 
--have put it between des and tgt in line with init.lua RegisterPackageExtensionInfo call
-- RegisterPackageExtensionInfo call seems to mostly match my derived order in reverse - however clo doesnt fit the order and lng isn't in its table.
